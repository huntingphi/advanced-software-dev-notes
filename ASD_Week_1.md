# Advanced Software Development

## Project Management

- Concerned with activities involved in ensuring software is delivered on time and on schedule and in accordance with the requirements of the organisations developing and procuring the software.
- Project Management is needed because software development is always subject to the **budget and schedule constraints** that are set by the organisation developing the software.

*Read Bennett Chapter 22*

- Systems development is a complex activity that requires careful project management

- Interdependencies between the artefacts of software development mean that production needs to be planned, monitored and coordinated so that development is effective efficient and on time
- A software development project may involve many developers, some with specialized skills who will be required at different times.
- Activities must follow a particular sequence

### Project Management Tools
- Basecamp
- Freedcamp
- TeamGantt
- Asana
- Slack
- Overleaf (Latex)

## Scope of a Project
- The functions and features that are to be delivered to end-users
- The user data that are input and output
- The content that is presented to users as a consequence of using the software
- The performance, constraints, interfaces and reliability that bound the system

*Side note: Agent based modelling: Lots of agents in the system, what is the aggregate result of the agents interacting in the system*

## Defining Scope
- Two techniques:
  - A narrative description of software scope is developed after communication o=with stakeholders (The client)
  - A set of use-cases is developed. A use-case is a scenario-based description of the user's interaction with the software from the users point of view
- Performance considerations encompass processing and response time requirements.
- Constraints identify limits placed on the software by external hardware, available memory or other existing systems.

## Determining Feasibility
- Given the scope, determine the resources required Eg. cost
- Make sure you have an answer to the question: "Do we have the resources we need to build this software?"
- Resources are:
  - People
  - Hardware and software tools
  - Reusable components

## Project Planning Goals aka Scope
- Goals are derived from the needs and expectations of stakeholders:
  - Project sponsor
  - Customer for the deliverables
  - Users of the project outputs
  - Project manager and project team
- Find true needs that create real benefits and prioritize them
- Create measurable (goals SMART accronym)

## Project Planning Deliverables
- Deliverables are a list of items that have to be delivered to meet the goals
  - Verifiable and specific
  - Can be a report, equipment acquisition, executable code module etc
  - Has a stakeholder who needs it
- Say when it is to be delivered
- Give quality standards

## Project Planning Schedule
- The effort required ito time
- The people required (and other resources)
- Update deliverables with this and work schedule out
- If the schedule is unrealistic the following can be justified:
  - Renegotiate deadline - delay the deadline
  - Additional resources - more expensive
  - Reduce scope - Fewer deliverables

## Project Planning Support Plans
1. Human Resource Plan
  - Name key individuals and organizations: describe roles and responsibilities
  - Describe the number and type of people needed
    - Start dates, estimated duration and how to get them
2. Communications and Management Plan
  - Who needs to be kept informed about the project?
  - How they will receive the information?
    - Weekly review meeting
    - Progress reports
    - Revised schedule
3. Risk Management Plan - see later
  - identify as many risks as possible
  - be prepared if something bad happens

## The Range of Management Activities
- 4 P's
  - People:
    - Managers, Project Managers, Team Leaders, Software Team, Customers, End Users
  - Product:
    - Scope and decomposition
  - Process
    - SDLC: Initiation -> Analysis -> Design -> Construct -> Test -> Implement
    - UP: Inception -> Elaboration -> Construction -> Transition -> Production
  - Project
    - Size estimation; scheduling; risk management; tracking
